**Python Indentation**
- Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

- Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

- Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

**Example:**

- The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, **the most common use is four**, but it has to be at least one.

- You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:

**Python Variables**

- In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:

- Python không yêu cầu phải khai báo biến.

**Comments**

- Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:
